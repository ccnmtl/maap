    <name>David Ruggles Home</name>
    <description><![CDATA[David Ruggles’ Home<br><br>David Ruggles might have been the most hated activist of his day. One slave catcher screamed that he would give “a thousand dollars if I had …Ruggles in my hands as he is the leader.” And Ruggles was just that—a leader against slavery. He came to New York around 1827 from Connecticut, where he was born free. When he arrived he was 17 years old—and fearless, determined, and educated. <br><br>The year 1827 was a time of parades celebrating the end of slavery in New York. More and more runaways were arriving from the South every day. But right behind them were the slave catchers. Called “blackbirders,” they roamed the streets looking to reclaim some of the runaways and even to kidnap free blacks. No black person was safe. Ruggles saw how dangerous the city was and decided to do something about it. <br><br>In 1835, he and several other young black activists founded the New York Committee of Vigilance. Ruggles and the rest of the Committee protected runaways and confronted the slave catchers. He made the city government grant jury trials to slaves who were recaptured, and he obtained lawyers for them. He personally helped as many as 600 fugitives, including the now-famous Frederick Douglass. He also ran an antislavery bookstore until it was destroyed by a mob. In addition, he wrote hundreds of articles. He bought a printing press and published his own pamphlets and a magazine called Mirror of Liberty. It was the first periodical published by a black American. But after 20 years of activism, Ruggles was nearly blind and seriously ill. Many, including Frederick Douglass, came to his aid. Ruggles died in Massachusetts in 1849.<br><br>Then<br>David Ruggles was the leading, and possibly the most hated, abolitionist in New York City. His courage, activism, and writings made the city a safer place for fugitives and free blacks. <br>[illustration of David Ruggles]<br><br>Now<br>Ruggles sheltered runaway Frederick Douglass here at 36 Lispenard Street. He also ran a boarding house at 67 Lispenard that was a meeting place for abolitionists.<br>[Photo: Plaque re Frederick Douglass at 36 Lispenard]<br><br>]]></description>

    <name>Black Brigades</name>
    <description><![CDATA[The Black Brigades<br><br>During the Revolution, at least 80,000 African Americans declared their own independence—and fled. The British had promised freedom to any slave who left a rebel master (but not a loyal one) and made it to British lines. Harry Washington, whose owner was the patriot General George Washington, was one of 800 who reached British lines in Virginia. He fought for “Liberty to Slaves” in an all-black regiment, and when the British left that colony for New York, he went with them.<br><br>By 1780, there were more than 10,000 blacks living in a British-occupied New York. Many lived in a “canvas city” of shanties and tents that sprang up between Broadway and the Hudson River. The area had been burned to the ground when the patriots abandoned the city. Blacks who fought with the British, like Harry Washington, lived in “Negro barracks” at 18 Broadway, 10 Church Street, and elsewhere. These men fought in units known as the Black Pioneers and the Black Brigade. Most did the hard support work the army needed, but some were armed and fought. The most famous Black Pioneer was Colonel Tye who led 800 men in a guerrilla war against the patriots in Staten Island and New Jersey.<br><br>When peace came, so did the slave hunters. In 1783, they roamed the city, seizing blacks from the streets and even from their beds. But much to General Washington’s dismay, the British refused to return those slaves that had been promised freedom. Instead, their names were written in the “The Book of Negroes,” and some 3,000 free African Americans climbed aboard British ships and sailed away. Harry Washington would eventually reach a place in Africa not far from where he was born.<br><br>Then<br>The handwritten “Book of Negroes” lists the names of some 3,000 African Americans who left New York City with the British. The book is located in the National Archives in Washington, D.C.<br>&nbsp;[Photo: the “Book of Negroes” from http://museum.gov.ns.ca/blackloyalists/17751800/Objects1775/booknegroes.htm]<br><br>Now<br>During the Revolution, many members of the Black Brigades or Black Pioneers who fought with the British lived in “Negro barracks” at 10 Church Street and elsewhere. <br>[Photo by Manjari of 10 Church Street today]<br><br>]]></description>

    <name>African Grove Theater</name>
    <description><![CDATA[African Grove Theater<br><br>On Mercer Street in the fall of 1821, King Lear limped out onto stage, and the audience went wild. Lear was black. The event was the first play staged by the first black theatrical producer, who had formed the first black theater company that went on to perform the first play written by an African American in the first black theater in the country.&nbsp; The genius behind it all was William Alexander Brown. <br><br>His venture began back in 1816 in a place Brown called The African Grove. During the summer, white New Yorkers enjoyed private “tea” gardens that offered ice cream treats, cold drinks, music, dramatic readings, and conversation. According to the papers, Brown opened the first tea garden to “which the sable race could find admission and refreshment.” It was a great success and led Brown to build the 300-seat theater on Mercer Street. Here his company staged popular versions of Shakespeare’s Richard the III and Othello. They also presented original works such as King Shotaway, a play written by Brown about a black Carib revolt in the Caribbean. <br>But the African American theater was an annoyance to the Park Theater nearby. Stephen Price, the producer of the Park, hired white rowdies to yell and “riot” at the African Grove. When the neighbors (including Price) complained, the police shut the theater down. The African Grove became a mobile theater for several years before closing its doors.<br><br>Then<br>James Hewlett (1778-1836) was the star performer at the African Grove Theater. As a youngster, Ira Aldridge, the greatest black actor of the 19th century, probably got his start here, too. <br>[photo of James Hewlett or Ira Aldridge in costume.]<br><br>Now<br>The first African Grove Theater was located on Mercer Street near Houston. It was built on the second floor of a two-story house with a large tea garden in back. <br>[Photo of the location of the theater on Mercer near Houston.] <br><br>]]></description>

    <name>Hughson&#39;s Tavern</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Hughson’s Tavern<br><br>In the spring of 1741, all eyes were on a tavern at the corner of Liberty and Trinity Streets. The tavern was on the waterfront then, and it was a meeting place for free and enslaved blacks as well as poor whites. It was illegal in those days for more than three slaves to meet unless they were working.<br><br>Trouble began after a burglary. The man charged with the crime was a slave called Caesar. When he was arrested at Hughson’s Tavern, investigators thought that John Hughson and his wife Sarah (who were white) were trading in stolen goods. Mary Burton, Hughson’s <br>16-year-old servant, was brought in for questioning. The investigators offered her a choice: She could tell all that she “knew” and gain freedom from being a servant, or go to prison. She chose the first option, and the Hughsons were quickly arrested. Then fires broke out—once there were four in one day. New Yorkers panicked, fearing the worst—another slave uprising. Again investigators turned to Mary Burton, and she again told them what they wanted to hear.<br><br>Mary claimed that Hughson’s Tavern was a meeting place for blacks and whites plotting to burn the city, murder its inhabitants, and seize power. The slaves would become masters, she said, and Caesar, the thief, would become governor. Her story was incredible, but it was believed. In the hysteria of “The Great Negro Plot” almost half of the adult black male population was arrested and brought to trial. In the end, 17 blacks were hanged, as well as the Hughsons and 2 other whites. Thirteen Africans were burned at the stake, and 70 enslaved blacks were shipped to the Caribbean to be resold.<br><br>Then<br>Hughson’s Tavern was on the waterfront in 1741. Its doors were open to blacks and poor whites, making it suspect during “The Great Negro Plot” of 1741.<br>[Photo: illustration of waterfront location of Hughson’s Tavern]<br><br>Now<br>Today, the site of Hughson’s Tavern at the corner of Liberty and Trinity Streets is far from the waterfront. What was once the location of docks for ships is now the site of the former World Trade Center. <br>[Photo by Manjari.]<br><br><br><br>]]></description>

    <name>St. Philip&#39;s Episcopalian Church</name>
    <description><![CDATA[St. Philip’s Episcopal Church<br><br>The congregation of St. Philip’s has roots that reach back to 1704. That was when Elias Neau, a Frenchman who had himself suffered slavery, opened his home to teach enslaved New Yorkers to read the Bible. Neau was connected to Trinity Church on Wall Street, and soon Neau’s students began to worship there on Sunday afternoons. Trinity Church was segregated. <br><br>As the black worshipers grew frustrated with the church’s refusal to condemn slavery or end the segregation, they began to meet separately, forming the Free African Church of St. Philip. In 1818, skilled carpenters among the group built a small wood church on Centre Street, near Worth.&nbsp; The church immediately became a center of mutual aid and anti-slavery activities as well as of worship. It grew to become one of the largest black congregations in New York, in spite of fires, racist attacks, and riots. After a fire burned the wooden church, a brick one was built. It survived a riot of 1834, when the church organ, furniture, and much of the building was destroyed by a white mob. It was attacked again during the Civil War Draft Riot, and the police used St. Philip’s as a barracks for militia and police as they battled thousands of enraged whites for control of the city. <br><br>As New York grew and blacks moved north, the church moved, too, first to 25th Street and finally to 134th Street in 1910. There, St. Philip’s continues its tradition of worship as well as its work for social and economic justice.<br><br>Then<br>St. Philip’s Episcopal Church was a black center for worship, mutual aid, and activism throughout the 1800s. It was located at 31 Centre Street between Worth and Leonard until 1886.<br>[Photo: John F.E. Prud’homme engraver, after William Bayley.

    <name>Execution Grounds</name>
    <description><![CDATA[The Execution Grounds<br><br>The year 1741 started out badly. Poor whites and blacks lived in fear of freezing or starving to death. There were food shortages and the winter set records as the coldest known. And then there were fires. First the governor’s house in Fort George burned to the ground. Then there were four fires in one day. People panicked, thinking it was a slave uprising—their worst fear.&nbsp; Africans were one-fifth of the community’s population, and there had been violent uprisings in the past and in other places. A hunt for the conspirators began, as more fires were set. <br><br>In this climate of hysteria, a grand jury quickly agreed that there was a plot to burn the city and kill its inhabitants. It was thought that there were ringleaders and that they must be white. The first arrested, mostly black men and a few whites, were thrown into jail in the basement of City Hall, where they were questioned and probably beaten. Large rewards, including freedom from indenture, were offered to any who would give evidence. An indentured servant named Mary Burton was the first to name names. She described a great plot, led by white ringleaders. This was just what the investigators wanted to hear. Soon others agreed to give names. It was not long before 160 black and 21 white men and women were arrested in “The Great Negro Plot.”<br><br>At trial the accused had no legal representation. All the lawyers were working for the prosecution. At least 34 people were convicted and brought to the Execution Grounds. Seventeen blacks were hanged, as well as four white “ringleaders.” Thirteen Africans were burned at the stake. The events were remembered as the “Bonfires of the Negroes.” An additional 70 enslaved African Americans were shipped to the Caribbean and sold.<br><br>Then<br>During the hysteria of the “Great Negro Plot,” 17 African Americans were hung and 13 were burned at the stake. The execution grounds were located on the African Burial Ground. <br><br>[Photo: illustrated map of the execution grounds]<br><br>Now<br>What was the execution grounds in 1741 is now Foley Square, located between Lafayette and Centre Streets. The four white people convicted in the plot were hung near the East River.<br>[Photo: of Foley Square by Manjari]<br><br>]]></description>

    <name>The Gideon and the Great Dock</name>
    <description><![CDATA[The Gideon and the Great Dock<br><br>On an August day in 1664, the Dutch ship Gideon reached the Great Dock in New Amsterdam. Its long journey had begun in the Netherlands, where it took on board wrist and ankle shackles, and other supplies for its mission. Its first stop was Angola, Africa, where the captain was directed to “as quickly as possible, take on board as many slaves as he can conveniently transport,” along with copper and elephant tusks. The ship then crossed the ocean to the Caribbean, where it delivered slaves and the other “cargo,” before proceeding to New Amsterdam. It arrived at the Great Dock with 291 Africans. To date, this was the largest shipment of enslaved men, women, and children to the Dutch colony. The Dutch West India Company relied on Africans to build homes, fortifications, and even the Great Dock. It was Africans who unloaded the Gideon. <br><br>Before the Gideon could be loaded again, British warships arrived. Without a single shot being fired, New Amsterdam became New York, and about 150 Dutch soldiers marched onto the Gideon to sail home. <br><br>The English took possession of a town with a population of about 1,500 whites, 300 slaves, and 75 freedmen. The largest slave owner was the Dutch West India Company, which had granted some of the older Africans a kind of half-freedom and plots of land. The Land of the Blacks was a group of 8-to-12-acre farms north of the town. The English were quick to question the freedom of these blacks and their landholdings. As difficult as life was for the Africans under the Dutch, it was about to get harsher.<br><br>Then<br>The Gideon, carrying 291 enslaved Africans, arrived at the Great Dock in 1664. Africans did most of the labor needed by the Dutch West India Company in New Amsterdam.<br><br>[Photo: NYPL, I.N.

    <name>Fort Amsterdam</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Fort Amsterdam<br><br>Fort Amsterdam was designed to be a state-of-the-art diamond-shaped fort, built of stone and bristling with cannon. The designer warned against building it in haste. However, in 1625, the town was in desperate need of houses, so a much simpler fort was planned. It would be roughly a square of four simple brick walls, mounded over with dirt.<br><br>To build the fort, Peter Minuit needed laborers, and in 1626 he got just what he needed. The Dutch West India Company sent the first African “bondsmen” to New Amsterdam. Some of their names described their origins: Antony Congo, Paulo d’Angola, Pieter San Tomé, Anthony the Portuguese, Jan Fort Orange. Many of the men had been captured from Spanish or Portuguese ships. They were experienced seamen who already understood some European languages, religions, and laws. <br><br>For 10 years the men worked to build the fort. They dug up tree stumps, hauled dirt, mounded it up over the fort walls, and battered it down firmly. Finally, the Africans covered the earthen walls of the fort with sod. But as soon as it was finished, the fort began to crumble. The settlers didn’t usually fence their animals, so goats, sheep, and cattle strayed onto the weedy slopes to graze. Pigs went there to dig or rout in the dirt walls. In the words of one settler, the fort soon looked “like a molehill or a tottering wall.” But the Africans were busy elsewhere. They had to dig ditches, clear land, plant and harvest crops, build houses, roads, and bridges, and load the Company’s ships with thousands of pelts of beaver, mink, otter, and wildcat. <br><br>Then<br>This picture shows Fort Amsterdam, and the Dutch Church built within it, behind a row of houses. On the shore you can see the company weighing beam and a tall crane used to unload cargo. <br>[Photo: NY001078 RM © Museum of the City of New York/CORBIS]<br><br>Now<br>The site of Fort Amsterdam, once used as a refuge for white settlers from Native Americans, is now occupied by the Museum of the American Indian.<br>[Photo: of the Museum of the American Indian]<br><br><br><br>]]></description>

    <name>The Slave Market</name>
    <description><![CDATA[The Slave Market<br>In 1711, New York was growing quickly, and the growing needs of the city were often supplied by slave labor. Nearly 1,000 out of about 6,400 New Yorkers were black, and at least 40 percent of the white households included a slave. In these homes, enslaved workers cooked, washed, sewed, hauled water, emptied the chamber pots, swept out the fireplaces and the chimneys, and cared for the children. Along the East River they built, loaded, and unloaded, the ships. They cleared the land uptown, and then planted and harvested the crops.&nbsp; And up and down the narrow streets they pedaled their master’s goods and even supplied the city’s first fast foods—fresh oysters and steaming hot corn on the cob. <br><br>As the number of slaves imported into the city soared, barrel makers, butchers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and tin workers began to purchase young enslaved men in order to teach them their trades. Typically, when a slave owner ran out of work, they hired their slaves out at half the rate of free labor. <br><br>Often the slaves themselves were sent out to find work. In a time when fear of a slave uprising was ever-present, the sight of so many enslaved men walking the streets looking to be hired caused alarm. Fearful white citizens began to complain. They demanded a market where slaves could be hired, bought, and sold. Finally, on December 13, 1711, the City Council passed a law “that all Negro and Indian slaves that are let out to hire…be hired at the Market house at the Wall Street Slip…” This market, known as the Meal Market (because grains were sold there), was located at the foot of Wall Street on the East River. It was the city’s first slave market.<br><br>Then<br>The Slave Market, located where Wall Street reached the East River, was established in 1711 as a place where enslaved blacks and Native Americans could be hired or purchased. <br>[Photo: illustration of the Slave Market]<br><br>Now<br>Today, the site of the Slave Market, located at the intersection of Wall Street and Water Street, is far from the water’s edge. <br>[Photo: Manjari photo of intersection.]<br><br>]]></description>

    <name>1 Wall St</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Wall Street<br><br>A gang of black men labored as long as daylight allowed, digging a three-foot-deep trench from the East River all the way across Manhattan Island to the Hudson River. The trench followed a rough path that ran along the north edge of the village. It was March 1653, and Governor Stuyvesant had been sent orders to fortify New Amsterdam. English warships were gathering in Boston Harbor, readying to sail south and take the Dutch colony. <br><br>The men digging the trench had names such as Paulo d’Angola, Simon Congo, and Anthony Portuguese. As their names showed, many were Africans that had worked aboard Spanish or Portuguese ships before the Dutch seized them. The Africans working were owned by the Dutch West India Company, but some had gained a form of half-freedom. They worked for themselves, but owed the company labor whenever needed. Half-free or enslaved, these Africans could own property, testify in court, bear arms in emergencies, attend church, and marry. But their children were not free.<br><br>When the Africans finished the trench, they formed a wall by standing big logs into it. Each log was 18 inches around and 12 feet long. Then they pounded dirt and stones back into the trench around the base of each log to make the wall strong. They built blockhouses at the ends of the wall, and gates were added where roads ran through it. But as soon as the wall was finished, it was no longer needed. The Netherlands and England had signed a peace treaty. But the wall built by the Africans gave the rough path that became a street a new name—Wall Street.<br><br>Then<br>In 1653, Africans built a wall across Manhattan in order to protect New Amsterdam from the English.&nbsp; You can see a plaque about the wall on the Bank of New York at One Wall Street.<br><br>[photo of plaque on the Bank of New York]<br><br>Now<br>The wall became Wall Street, which is now the financial capital of the world. Up until the Civil War and long after slavery in New York was illegal, Wall Street firms profited from the slave trade.<br>[Photo: Wall Street today shot by Manjari] <br><br>]]></description>

    <name>The Land of the Blacks</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Minetta Ln<br>In the hills and swamps that stretched across Manhattan Island one mile north of New Amsterdam, both free and enslaved blacks began to clear the tangle of trees, vines, and shrubs to build their own homes and plant their own gardens. The time was 1643, and the area would soon be called the Land of the Blacks. <br><br>The black settlement began during the Dutch wars with neighboring Indians. When raids began, the white settlers fled to the safety of New Amsterdam. Director-General Willem Kieft decided to replace the white settlers with black ones, as a buffer for the community. The first land grants were given to members of the black militia such as Domingo Anthony and “Captain of the Blacks” Manuel Trumpeter, or their widows, such as Catalina Anthony. The grants were sizeable, from eight to twelve acres each, enough land for a garden, crops, and pasture for their cattle, goats, and sheep. Orchards were planted and included trees of apples, peaches, plums, and cherries.&nbsp; The homes and barns were mostly wooden with roofs of thatch or board. &nbsp;<br><br>Many of those who gained land grants were elders who had won a status we know as half-freedom, but their children remained enslaved. Nevertheless, the farms were passed down through the generations, creating a strong black community that petitioned for their rights, married, baptized their children and, at least a century before the Underground Railroad, harbored runaways.<br><br>Then<br>The Land of the Blacks included parts of Chinatown, Little Italy, SoHo, and Greenwich Village. Washington Square Park includes land once owned by five Africans.<br><br>[Photo of Washington Square Park by Manjari.

    <name>John Street Church</name>
    <description><![CDATA[John Street Church<br>At the opening of the John Street Methodist Church, the priest addressed "those in the gallery," welcoming the African Americans. The segregated black worshipers could cook the food, clean the homes, and care for the children of the white worshipers, but they could not pray together with them. In other churches, the segregation was far worse. Some churches had “hidden galleries,” small closed rooms out of sight. Other churches had “negro pews” in corners or over stairways. Black parishioners could not vote or preach, but they could offer their services in the form of labor.<br><br>At the John Street Church, African Peter Williams was a sexton. He probably dug the graves, swept the church, and kept up the grounds. James Varick was a deacon, a church officer who probably helped the priest give communion to the black worshipers—only after the whites had received communion. <br><br>Williams and Varick had attended the church since it was founded in 1766. This was a time of change. During the Revolution, British soldiers occupied the city.&nbsp; After that, General George Washington came to reclaim the city and the slaves that had fled to the British there. But the church’s practice of segregation remained the same. Williams, Varick, and other black worshipers began to hold separate meetings. Then the group decided to form a separate church. In October of 1800, the African Methodist Episcopal Church at the corner of Church and Leonard Streets was dedicated. It would become an enduring place of worship and struggle. <br><br>Then<br>The John Street Church welcomed Peter Williams and other African worshipers, but blacks and whites were segregated. In the early 1800s, a group separated to form the first black church in the state.<br>[Photo: painting of Peter Williams Sr., NY Historical Society]<br><br>Now<br>Today the John Street Church is still located at 44 John Street.

    <name>African Free School</name>
    <description><![CDATA[The African Free School<br><br>Soon after the Revolution, in 1785, a group of wealthy, powerful white men formed the New York Manumission Society. Although many were slave owners, their mission was to aid the enslaved, and to gradually end slavery in the state. As part of their efforts, they opened the African Free School in 1788, where the children of both free and enslaved blacks were taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography. The boys also studied astronomy, a skill needed by seamen, and the girls learned sewing and knitting. The school had many visitors—especially on examination days when students could show off their work to outsiders. In this way, they could prove to doubting New Yorkers that black students were “not inferior to those of fairer complexions…in acquiring a knowledge of Letters.” <br><br>The school began with about 40 students in one room. In the 1820s, as the date of freedom for New York’s slaves drew near, the enrollment grew to 800 students. By 1834, when the African Free schools were absorbed into the New York public school system, over 1,400 students were enrolled in seven school buildings.<br><br>Many of the students of the African Free School went on to become community leaders. James McCune Smith became the first African American licensed doctor, Henry Highland Garnett was a leading abolitionist and the first African American to address Congress, and Ira Aldridge became the most famous African American actor of his day. As students these men had learned the art of public speaking. As adults, many used that skill to speak out for freedom, justice, and equality for their race.<br><br>Then<br>This picture of African Free School #2 is based on a drawing by one of its students named Patrick Reason. He, like many of his fellow students, went on to become a leading abolitionist.<br>[Photo: engraving of African free School from drawing by Patrick Reason; Schomburg]<br><br>Now<br>African Free School #2 was located at 135-137 Mulberry Street in the neighborhood then known as Five Points. All together, there were at least seven African Free Schools in the city.<br><br>[photo of 135-137 Mulberry Street.]<br><br>]]></description>

    <name>Seneca Village </name>
    <description><![CDATA[Seneca Village<br><br>As a community of free black property owners, Seneca Village was unique in its day. Located in the hilly, rock-strewn woods between present-day 82nd and 89th Streets and 7th and 8th Avenues, at the time it was a long walk to the crowded city. The village grew steadily from 1825, when Andrew Williams first bought three lots for $125. By 1832, about 25 more lots were sold to African Americans. And by the early 1850s, the village boasted three churches, a school, and a population of some 300 people. Over the years, German and Irish immigrants joined the community. This diverse community lived in peace, attending the All Angel’s Church together and sharing the services of one midwife. <br><br>But as the city pushed north, the media began to paint a different picture of the little village, calling it a “shantytown” and calling the property owners “squatters” who were “wretched and debased.” Many people in the city, including Mayor Fernando Wood, wanted the land for a great new park. In 1855, the mayor used the power of eminent domain to claim the land. Then he sent the police to clear it. For two years the residents resisted the police as they petitioned the courts to save their homes, churches, and schools. In 1857, they were finally removed. As one newspaper put it, the raid upon Seneca Village would “not be forgotten…[as] many a brilliant and stirring fight was had during the campaign. But the supremacy of the law was upheld by the policeman’s bludgeons.”<br><br>Then<br>Seneca Village thrived as a largely black community from 1825 to 1855, when the land was made part of Central Park by the city.<br>[illustration of Seneca village]<br>Now<br>Today, as you walk in Central Park near West Drive and 85th Street, you can see a plaque commemorating Seneca Village. <br>[Photo of the plaque in Central Park]<br><br><br><br>]]></description>

    <name>Freedom’s Journal</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Freedom’s Journal<br><br>Before 1827, blacks didn’t exist in the newspapers, unless they committed a crime. African American weddings, births, deaths, and accomplishments were not to be found in a newspaper anywhere in the United States. But the year 1827 saw big changes. New York finally abolished slavery, and two young black men, John Brown Russwurm and Samuel E. Cornish, founded Freedom’s Journal. It was the first African American owned and operated newspaper in the country. <br><br>For most of the black community, reading came only after freedom, since it had been forbidden under slavery. To read black voices for the first time was powerful. On the front page of the new paper the editors wrote: “We wish to plead our own cause. Too long have others spoken for us.” Inside were stories about slavery, lynchings, and social justice. The paper also covered international news of special interest to the community, such as events in Haiti and Sierra Leone. In addition, the paper featured biographies of black men and women, schools, jobs, and housing opportunities. It also listed weddings, births, and deaths.<br>For two years Freedom’s Journal served a community of 300,000 African Americans in the North. It was sent to 11 states and the District of Columbia, as well as to Haiti, Europe, and Canada. It was followed by no less than 24 other black newspapers in the years before the Civil War.<br>Then<br>Samuel E. Cornish, a preacher, and John Brown Russwurm, a scholar, founded the nation’s first black newspaper in 1827. They called it Freedom’s Journal. <br><br>[Photo: combined image of John Brown Russwurm &amp; Samuel E. Cornish with Freedom’s Journal masthead.

    <description><![CDATA[Downing’s Oyster House<br><br>Before New York was called the Big Apple, it could have been called the Big Oyster. New York was famous for its oysters. And Thomas Downing, a free black man, owned the most famous oyster house of all. Bankers, politicians, stockbrokers, lawyers, businessmen, and socialites flocked to Downing’s Oyster House to eat raw, fried, or stewed oysters, oyster pie, fish with oyster sauce, or poached turkey stuffed with oysters. As the crowd of power brokers ate and made deals under the chandeliers, Thomas’s son George lead escaping slaves to the basement. There they were safe from the “blackbirders,” or bounty hunters, that were roaming the streets in search of runaways. <br><br>From 1825 to 1860, Thomas, and his son George T. Downing were part of the Underground Railroad to Canada and freedom. They were also leaders in the growing abolitionist movement. In 1836, Thomas helped found the all-black United Anti-Slavery Society of the City of New York. The next year he began petitioning New York State for equal suffrage for black men. He took one petition after another to Albany. "If one petition failed, another would be presented," he said. When not a single high school in the city would accept African American students, he helped found the first schools that would accept them. According to his son, Thomas Downing was an "extremely active" man who "knew not tire."<br><br>When Thomas Downing died on April 10, 1866, the New York Chamber of Commerce closed for the day out of respect.<br><br>Then<br>Thomas Downing rowed out to the boats to pick over the oysters before the ships reached the oyster barges along the East River.

    <name>James McCune Smith Pharmacy</name>
    <description><![CDATA[James McCune Smith Pharmacy<br><br>In 1824, the aged Revolutionary War hero General Lafayette returned to America for a tour of the nation he had helped to forge. While in New York he asked to visit the African Free School. James McCune Smith was chosen to write and deliver the welcoming address. Smith was 11 years old. <br><br>Smith was a brilliant student who wanted to become a doctor. But there were no licensed black doctors in America then, so he was apprenticed to a blacksmith instead. As Smith worked the blacksmith’s bellows with one hand, he held a Latin grammar in the other and continued to study. But when he applied to Columbia College (called Kings College then) he was turned down. So instead he went to one of the world’s top medical schools in Great Britain. In five years he earned three degrees and graduated at the top of his class.<br><br>Upon his return to New York he opened a pharmacy at 93 West Broadway in 1837. Here he served both white and black patients in the front of the store. In the back, he met with fellow activists and conspired to end slavery in the South, to win the vote for blacks in New York, and to educate black youth. Together with abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass, Gerrit Smith, and John Brown, he helped found the Radical Abolitionist Party. As the son of a self-emancipated mother, his pharmacy was a place where many escaping slaves found help. James McCune Smith worked for economic and social justice until his death in 1865, just a few weeks after passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. &nbsp;<br><br>Then<br>Dr. James McCune Smith was the first licensed African American doctor in the country.

    <name>Mother AME Zion Church</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Mother AME Zion Church<br><br>In the late 1700s, the Methodists of the mostly white John Street Church welcomed Africans and their descendents, and many came to worship there. Peter Williams, born a slave, became a sexton and James Varick became a deacon of the church. In time, however, the worshipers in the Negro pews grew frustrated. They wanted to speak out against slavery and to worship as equals. Finally, in 1796, James Varick led a group of about 100 worshipers to an old rented building on Cross Street to worship separately. This congregation would found the Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, the first black church in the state. <br>By 1800, the group moved into a small wooden building at the corner of Church and Leonard Streets. The church thrived, and by 1820, Mother Zion had a new brick building. That same year the leaders voted to leave the White Methodist Episcopal Church because it would not ordain black bishops. James Varick became the first Bishop of the new church. It was a time when more and more black New Yorkers were gaining their freedom. These newly free African Americans were determined to end slavery in the South and racism in the North. The AME Church played a big part in the activism of that time. It was a stop on the Underground Railroad and many who worshiped there, such as Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth, became leaders and abolitionists. <br>As African Americans moved uptown, so did the church.

    <name>Pierre Toussaint</name>
    <description><![CDATA[In 1996, Pope John Paul II bestowed the title of “Venerable” on Pierre Toussaint. Two years later, Pierre Toussaint Square was named for him. This man, who was brought to New York as a slave in 1787, may soon become the first Haitian saint.<br><br>Toussaint was raised as a slave in the household of Jean Berard, a family of devout Catholics who taught him both reading and writing. When the family fled the revolution on their island, they brought Pierre and his sister Rosalie with them. Pierre was immediately apprenticed to a hairdresser, and went on to become one of the best in the city. At that time, wealthy women would spend $1000 a year on their hairdos, so Toussaint was able to make very good money. But what he did with his money is more extraordinary.<br><br>When his master died, Toussaint supported his mistress. He bought his sister’s freedom rather than his own, so that she could marry and bear free children. He bought his future wife’s freedom and helped many other slaves to buy theirs. He donated money to his beloved Church, to ministers and nuns, to orphans white and black, and to countless other causes. Not only did he donate money, but he also visited the sick and nursed them during yellow fever epidemics when no one else dared to. <br><br>Upon his death in 1853, the city mourned him, the papers eulogized him, and the great Revolutionary leader General Philip Schuyler said of him, “I have known Christians who were not gentlemen or gentlemen who were not Christians--but one man I know who is both--and that man is Black.”<br><br>Then<br>Pierre Toussaint and his wife Juliette Noel Toussaint lived in a comfortable home on Franklin Street and attended services nearby at St. Peter’s Church at 16 Barclay Street.<br>&nbsp;[Photo: Toussaint, New York Historical Society owned by the Society]<br><br>Now<br>In 1953, this marker was laid in Toussaint’s honor at St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral on Mott Street.

    <name>The Theodore Wright House</name>
    <description><![CDATA[One day in the mid-1800s, 28 men, women, and children snuck into New York City. They were runaways, escaping slavery on the Underground Railroad. Theodore Wright and his friend Charles Ray spent the day getting food for them, as well as passage on a barge to Albany. From there, all 28 fled to Canada, where they could live free. Wright helped many slaves to freedom, but there are few documents that tell about his work, since it was illegal. <br><br>Theodore Sedgwick Wright was born in 1797 and educated at the African Free School. He went on to become the first black graduate of the Princeton Theological Seminary. Wright was born free, but he hated slavery and did everything in his power to fight it. His home was a station on the Underground Railroad, and he spoke out against slavery from the pulpit of his church on Prince Street. He was a founding member of the American Anti-Slavery Society and president of the New York Committee of Vigilance. To belong to abolitionist societies at that time took courage. During the riots of 1834, white toughs attacked the offices and homes of abolitionists, breaking and burning everything they could lay their hands on. <br><br>As slavery was in the process of being abolished in New York, Wright was one of the first to speak out against racism. At an anti-slavery convention of both white and black delegates, he boldly stated, “It is an easy thing to ask about the vileness of slavery, but to treat the man of color in all circumstances as a man and brother -- that is the test.” Wright died in 1847, as slavery was spreading to the West.<br><br>Then<br>Theodore S. Wright was born free and was well educated, but he risked his own home and well-being every time he helped a runaway reach freedom in Canada.<br><br>[photo of a reward poster for a runaway slave.]<br><br>Now<br>Wright’s home at 235 W.

    <name>African Society for Mutual Relief</name>
    <description><![CDATA[As soon as it was legal for black New Yorkers to organize, they did so. In 1808, the African Society for Mutual Relief was founded. (The Society may have met in secret earlier, but there are no records to prove it.) At that time, black children could not go to white schools. If their parents died, white orphanages were closed to them. Insurance companies would not sell policies to African Americans. Even graveyards were segregated. As a result, the Society formed a much-needed safety net for African American families and small businesses. Members’ dues paid for burial costs and a form of health insurance. If a member died, their widow and children received help. <br><br>In 1810, the New York Legislature granted their petition and the Society became the first incorporated African American association. Members celebrated the event with a parade and took to the streets carrying silk banners and signs. The association grew quickly. <br><br>In the beginning money was short, but in 1820 a former Haitian slave named Juliet Toussaint donated enough money for a plot of land and a meetinghouse at 42 Baxter Street (called Orange Street then). Located in the Five Points neighborhood, the African Hall for Mutual Relief became an important meeting place, a school, and a stop on the Underground Railroad. It was also a target. In the anti-abolitionist riot of 1834, a white mob attacked the Hall, breaking all the windows and wrecking the place. But the society survived that riot, as well as the draft riot of 1863, and lasted until 1945.<br><br>Then<br>Juliet Toussaint, a member of the growing Haitian community in New York, donated money for the African Hall for Mutual Relief in 1820.

    <description><![CDATA[Best known as the place where Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, the Audubon Ballroom has long been a center of African American social and political activity.<br><br>Located at 3940 Broadway between 165th and 166th Streets in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, the theater was developed by William Fox, a Hungarian immigrant who founded the Fox Film Company in 1915.<br><br>Designed by Thomas Lamb, one of the leading theater designers of the time, the building’s Broadway façade featured a three-dimensional terra cotta boat with the head of Neptune, based on the mythical ship Argo of Jason and the Argonauts fame.<br><br>The ballroom, located on the 2nd floor, served as a venue for a number of important historical events, such as the meeting place for the Municipal Transit Workers Union.<br>It also was the venue for the annual New York Mardis Gras festival, when a King and Queen of Harlem were crowned.<br><br>More recently the site has been controversial because of a plan by the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, which purchased the property from the city of New York, to raze it and build a medical research center.<br><br>African Americans protested the demolition and a compromise was reached, whereby part of the original building would remain and a memorial to Malcolm X would be created. A statue of Malcolm X now stands in the Broadway lobby. In 1997, David Graves, a California artist, created a 12-by-63-feet mural to honor Malcolm X’s achievements.<br><br>]]></description>

    <name>The Manhattan Company</name>
    <description><![CDATA[The Manhattan Company was formed to bring fresh water to New Yorkers. Or at least that was its stated purpose. What the founders really wanted to do was to open a bank. In the end they did both. The Bank of the Manhattan Company, founded in 1799, was a huge success. Today it is known as JP Morgan Chase. The company’s mission to deliver fresh water to New Yorkers was not as successful, however. <br><br>The city in 1800 reached as far north as Chambers Street. Above that were widely spaced homes and farms along dirt roads. There were also slaughterhouses and places where animal hides were tanned—both very smelly businesses, located near what was once a supply of good fresh water called the Collect Pond. <br><br>The plan was to build a waterworks on Reade Street near the pond and pump the water around the city through a network of log pipes. It was a big job. About 25 miles of pipe had to be laid. The streets were paved with heavy cobblestones, which had to be torn up. Then a deep trench was dug and the hollowed pine logs -- each 13 feet long and 13 inches in diameter -- were laid in the trench and pounded together. Sand and earth were placed back in the trench, and any leftover dirt was carted away. <br><br>The laborers made one dollar a day, but if the worker was enslaved, his or her earnings went to the owner. At that time enslaved men and women were sometimes sent to the Slave Market at the end of Wall Street to hire themselves out. There were many free Africans in the city, too, but it was harder for them to get good-paying jobs.<br><br>Then<br>Around 1801 workers lay log water pipes along Broad Street as officials from the Manhattan Company look on. The workers laid 25 miles of pipe in the city’s first water system.<br><br>[photo Mural painting by Ezra Winter installed in the Manhattan Company headquarters at 40 Wall Street now at Chase Manhattan Archives

    <name>Rikers Island</name>
    <description><![CDATA[On March 5, 1864, a crowd of over 10,000 New Yorkers watched in awe as 1,000 well-disciplined Union army troops left Rikers Island and marched west to the Hudson River, their dark blue uniforms and crisp white gloves and white leggings glistening in the sunlight.<br><br>What made this event so unusual was that the soldiers were black.<br><br>The 20th Colored Regiment was formed by the New York Union League, who hoped to present the black troops as part of the New Society that would take place once the South was defeated and the country united. George Bliss, a prominent member of the Union League who later became the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York City, led the effort to raise money for the formation of New York’s three black regiments.<br><br>The troops received their training at Rikers Island before being sent to Louisiana. The 20th and the 26th Regiments were part of the 7,500 black soldiers who served the Union cause. These troops were paid less than half of their white counterparts’ salaries, received inferior equipment, and lived in poor conditions.<br><br>Near the end of 1864, Rikers Island was transformed from a camp where soldiers were sent for temporary duty and training to a prisoner of war facility for Confederate soldiers.<br><br>The city of New York purchased the island in 1884 from the Riker family, who had settled it in 1638. Today it is New York City’s largest jail facility.<br><br>247 words<br>]]></description>

    <name>The African Burial Ground</name>
    <description><![CDATA[The AFBG is a federally designated historic landmark and archaeological site that was used as a cemetery by free and enslaved people of African descent during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It’s believed that between 10,000 and 20,000 people are buried here. The site covers approximately 7 acres and is bounded by Duane Street on the north, Chambers Street on the south, Centre and Lafayette Streets on the east, and Broadway to the west.<br><br>In 1991, archaeological fieldwork began. While excavating a site for a new building at 290 Broadway, construction workers discovered skeletal remains of early Africans. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993 because of its unprecedented potential to provide information about the lives of early Africans, including their quality of health and the region of Africa they came from. (One previously unknown fact: The mortality rate for children under 16 years old was 43% based on a sample of 301 individuals buried at the site.) The information gathered by archaeologists and historians significantly altered historical misconceptions about the life and culture of Africans. And burial practices revealed at the site reflected the cultural and religious beliefs of enslaved people that had previously been undocumented -- such as the fact that many of the people buried here had played a significant role in the building of New York City.<br><br>Mayor David Dinkins, Lt. Gov. David Patterson, Illinois Congressman Gus Savage, Dr. Michael Blakey, and a Howard University team of researchers deserve recognition for the key role that they played in preserving this crucial part of African American history.<br><br>]]></description>

    <name>The Tappan Brothers</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Lewis and Arthur Tappan were brothers who earned a fortune importing silk from Asia. In 1841, Lewis went on to form the Mercantile Agency. Today it is known as Dun and Bradstreet, a billion-dollar corporation. <br><br>At that time, more and more white New Yorkers were in favor of ending slavery, but very few were for equal rights. The Tappans were different. They demanded “universal liberty.” Whites, such as the Tappans, who spoke out for equality were hated and often targeted. During the riots of 1834, pro-slavery mobs attacked the Tappans repeatedly. First the Chatham Chapel, which the brothers rented for abolitionist meetings, was attacked. The next day Lewis’s home was attacked; his belongings were piled in the street and burned. Then Arthur’s store was attacked—twice. A year later a $100,000 reward was offered to anyone who delivered the dead bodies of the Tappans to any slave state. The only protection Lewis relied on was the bible in his breast pocket. Both brothers drew on their faith for strength and continued their abolitionist work.<br><br>Working with African Americans such as Frederick Douglass, Samuel Cornish, and Henry Highland Garnet, the brothers accomplished many things. They helped found the New York Anti-Slavery Society and were actively part of the Underground Railroad. Lewis organized the defense for the Africans of the slave ship Amistad. The brothers also gave money to integrated colleges, abolitionist newspapers, and many other anti-slavery organizations. Arthur Tappan died in 1865, the year that the 13th Amendment outlawed slavery. Lewis Tappan died 8 years later.<br><br>Then<br>Arthur and Lewis Tappan were brothers, businessmen, and staunch abolitionists. Because they worked with black leaders for equal rights, they were attacked in the press and on the streets.<br>[research photo of Arthur and Lewis Tappan.]<br><br>Now<br>The offices of Arthur and Lewis Tappan were located at 122 Pearl Street. When pro-slavery mobs attacked during the riots of 1834, clerks fought them off with firearms.<br><br>[Photo of 122 Pearl Street location my Manjari]<br><br>]]></description>

    <name>Five Points</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Five Points was a neighborhood around the intersection of Worth Street, Baxter Street, and Cross Street, which no longer exists. It became a world-famous slum in the 1840s. In colonial times, however, it was a quiet place north of the city that included a pond, marshes, and a hill that overlooked it all. Africans buried their dead near the pond and lived nearby in a large area called “Land of the Blacks.” <br><br>By the early 1800s, however, the city was growing and housing was needed. The hill was removed and its earth, along with garbage, dumped into the pond. Homes and businesses were built on this landfill, but the ground was soft and damp; the houses soon began to rot and topple, and the unpaved streets turned to mud. As the housing decayed, New York’s first slum was born. Poor Irish and German immigrants moved in to live alongside the African Americans there. <br><br>The neighborhood became famous for crime and disease. But, more happily, it was also known for dance. Competitions between Irish and black musicians and dancers helped to invent a brand new dance form called tap dance. <br><br>Five Points was also where many abolitionist organizations were located. There was the Chatham Chapel, where black and white abolitionists met, and the African American Mutual Relief Hall. Churches such St. Philip’s African Episcopal Church and the African Bethlehem Church were part of the Underground Railroad, as were many of the homes in the area. Five Points was a dangerous neighborhood, but it was also a safe haven for those fleeing slavery.<br><br>Then<br>In the 1830s, free blacks and Irish and German immigrants lived crowded together in Five Points. “The most dangerous place in the city” was also a safe haven for those escaping slavery.<br><br>[Photo: George Catlin, Five Points, 1827.From Valentine's Manual, 1855.

    <name>Catherine Ferguson</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Catherine (“Katy”) Ferguson was born in 1779 with almost nothing—not even freedom. Her mother was sold away when she was 8 years old. That was when Katy became determined to gain her freedom and to make the world a better place. She did both.<br><br>First she wanted to learn to read. Her mistress said she was too smart already—smarter than her own children — and refused her. At the age of 10 she asked her master for her freedom, promising to live a life serving God. He refused her. At 16 she found a woman who agreed to purchase her freedom for $200 if Katy would repay her. It took Katy 11 months of work to pay $100 back; then someone in her church paid the remaining debt. Katy was finally free. <br><br>To make a living she made wedding cakes, the best in town. The rest of the time she helped others. She began to take children in off the street on Sundays and got others to teach them to read the bible.&nbsp; When her minister heard what she was doing, he offered to move the group to the basement of his church. Some say this was the first Sunday school in the city. <br><br>Katy also took in a total of 48 needy children, 20 of them white. She cared for them, fed them, and found them all good homes. When Ferguson died, the newspapers wrote, “Thousands in this community have heard of or known Katy Ferguson…the celebrated cake-maker for weddings and other social parties. But many…may be ignorant of the… extraordinary good deeds which crowned her life.” The reporter also said that wherever Katy lived, the whole neighborhood became a better place for it.<br><br>Then<br>Catherine Ferguson, or “Katy” as she was called, was determined from the age of 8 to gain her freedom and make the world a better place.

    <name>Fraunces Tavern</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Around the time of the American Revolution, everyone in New York knew Samuel Fraunces. He ran the best tavern in town, supported the patriot cause, and was a trusted aid to George Washington himself. His daughter, Phoebe, once saved the General’s life when she foiled a plot to poison him. But today little is known about Samuel Fraunces—even his race is a bit of a mystery. He was called “Black Sam,” but he was, and still is, described as being white, Negro, “colored,” Haitian, and mulatto. <br><br>Samuel Fraunces came to New York City from the Caribbean and in 1762 opened what is now called Fraunces Tavern. From the start his tavern was famous for its great food and fine wines, but today Fraunces Tavern is known for the history that was made there: It’s where New York’s Sons of Liberty met and planned their own Boston-style tea party. After the group dumped English tea in the harbor, the British occupied the city, and Samuel Fraunces moved his family to safety in New Jersey. Then he signed up as a patriot soldier and fought with George Washington. He also spied for the patriot cause, gave money, and housed and fed American soldiers and prisoners. When the British finally sailed away, a great celebration in honor of “Evacuation Day” was held in the Fraunces Tavern. A week later, Washington made a famous farewell speech to his officers there. <br><br>After the war Washington thanked Fraunces for giving so much “…to the cause of our country and its independence and freedom,” and Congress sent him a letter citing both his generous support of American prisoners and his secret service during the war. Samuel Fraunces died in 1795.<br><br>Then<br>Samuel Fraunces, known as “Black Sam,” bought 54 Pearl Street for a tavern in 1762. Well known in its day, Fraunces Tavern became famous for the history made there.<br><br>[Photo: photo by Manjari of building ]<br><br>Now<br>Today Fraunces Tavern is a museum operated by the Sons of the Revolution.

    <name>Sojourner Truth</name>
    <description><![CDATA[In 1797, a baby girl named Isabella was born in upstate New York. Her parents were Elizabeth and James Baumfree, but she was the property of their Dutch master, who sold her off at the age of 9. By the time she was 12, she had been sold two more times. When slavery was outlawed in New York, Isabella was 30 years old, the mother of four surviving children, and finally free to leave. She reached New York City in 1829 and joined the Mother AME Zion Church. Known as a preacher and prophet, she spent 14 years in the city before suddenly declaring, “The Spirit calls me there and I must go.” That day in 1843 she left to travel the land and spread the Lord’s word as Sojourner Truth. <br><br>Sojourner Truth traveled throughout New England and as far west as Kansas. When she spoke, everyone listened—even the hecklers. She gave her most famous speech at a women’s rights convention in Ohio. As one there remembered it, the hecklers were hissing but, “At her first word there was a profound hush.” When one man called women “weak,” Truth looked him in the eye and in her low voice said, “I could work as much and eat as much as a man (when I could get it), and bear the lash as well -- and ain’t I a woman?” Another time she stopped the hissing with “…we’ll have our rights; see if we don't: and you can’t stop us from them; see if you can. You may hiss as much as you like, but it is comin’.”<br><br>A legend in her own time, Sojourner Truth died in 1883 in Battle Creek, Michigan. Her funeral was said to be the largest ever seen there.<br><br>Then<br>Born a slave in 1797 in Ulster County, New York, Sojourner Truth spoke out against slavery and injustice, and for women’s rights, making people from President Lincoln to street toughs listen. <br><br>[Research photo of Sojourner Truth—could be the one with Abraham Lincoln]<br><br>Now<br>While living in New York City, Isabella Baumfree became Sojourner Truth and left her home at 74 Canal Street to spread the “Lord’s truth.” She became a legend in her own time.<br><br>[Photo: Manjari photo of 74 Canal Street.] <br><br>]]></description>

    <name>Bridge Street AWME Church</name>
    <description><![CDATA[It was October 1865, only months after the last shots of the Civil War were fired. People in Brooklyn opened their newspaper, the Brooklyn Eagle, to learn that “Last evening an immense congregation, fully half consisting of whites, was present at the African M. E. Church in Bridge street.” What brought so many white people to the black church? Harriet Tubman, the most famous “conductor” on the Underground Railroad, was speaking. Moses, as she was called, was in a familiar place. Before the Civil War she had led some 300 enslaved men, women, and children to freedom by hiding in “stations” such as the Bridge Street Church during the day and traveling at night. <br><br>The original church, known as the Sand Street Methodist Episcopal Church, was founded by a British army captain in 1766. He first led open-air services for a congregation of blacks, whites, and Indians near the banks of the East River. The congregation grew and the church moved indoors. Unfortunately, racism eventually developed, and the African Americans were first segregated and then barred from the altar and charged a fee for worshiping. <br><br>The black worshipers broke away in 1816 and organized the African Methodist Episcopal Church on High Street. Later, when it moved, it was called the Bridge Street Church. The congregation could claim many firsts. They had the first black church in Brooklyn. It was located in Weeksville, one of the first black communities in the city. And in 1827, the congregation opened Brooklyn’s first school for black children.<br><br>Then<br>Runaway slaves were once hidden in the basement of the Bridge Street Church at 311 Bridge Street. Today the site is the Student Center of Polytechnic University.<br><br>[Photo: research photo, or Manjari photo of the Student Center of Polytechnic University/Bridge Street Church.
